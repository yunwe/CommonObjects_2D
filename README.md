Stopping spinner at pre-defined index is very useful if we want to control the output. You can test it by typing in the stop index before clicking stop button.
I calculated deceleration to stop the wheel with desire effect. However, it have some error rate. It works fine with large slots but if your spinner have too many small slots, please be aware the pitfall.
