# CommonObjects_2D
Collection of 2d common game objects I tested in my free time. For each objects, they have their own directory under `Assets` folder. A sample scene, sprites, and scripts are organized in that folder.

Stopping spinner at pre-defined index is very useful if we want to control the output. You can test it by typing the stop index before clicking stop button.
I calculated deceleration to stop the wheel to get desire effect. However, it have some error rate. It works fine with large slots but of your spinner have too many small slots, please be aware the pitfall.
